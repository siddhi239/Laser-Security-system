# Laser-Security-system
The Project mainly deals with the design and implementation of LASER SECURITY SYSTEM for detecting intruders. 

# Introduction
The prime advantage of using the Laser security system is that the intruder is unaware of the fact that a security system is installed in the entry points like doors and windows since laser rays can travel long distances and are almost invisible.
